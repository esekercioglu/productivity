## Description 
A series of simple (perhaps a bit crude) productivity tracking tools and dashboards. Most useful for office workers who need to perform and track repetitive tasks

## overview

I started creating these tools when Google Chrome Extension we used in the office stopped functioning. The basic idea was a counter. You click on the extension icon and it increments the counter by one. Replicating that would be simple enough. However, in our workflow a simple ticket counter was not useful enough anyway so I decided to design a tool that can be customized easily by the user, do not require any installation (company policy prohibited us from adding third party applications) and fit in the toolkit we used on a daily basis.

These requirements limited the parameters of the project as follows: it had to be web based or available on Google Sheets (I ended up designing both versions), it needed to be customizable so agents with different task sets can utilize it according to their needs, and it needed to fit on a split screen (people in our team usually divided their screen real estate limit switches from screen to screen).
